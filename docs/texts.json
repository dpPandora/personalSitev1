I haven't changed my legal name yet).<br><br>I don't actually know what to put here,,,<br><br>Well, currently I'm attending a coding bootcamp at Ironhack for web development! Before that I was attending Florida Polytechnic University but I left because I felt like, for learning web development, it was just a bunch of fluff and unneed stress.<br><br>I really like programming and just making stuff in general. Truthfuly, I really want/wanted to go into game development but with how much as come to light about the working conditions and expectations I decided to stick to it as a hobby."
