I haven't changed my legal name yet).<br><br>I don't actually know what to put here,,,<br><br>Well, currently I'm attending a coding bootcamp at Ironhack for web development! Before that I was attending Florida Polytechnic University but I left because I felt like, for learning web development, it was just a bunch of fluff and unneed stress.<br><br>I really like programming and just making stuff in general. Truthfuly, I really want/wanted to go into game development but with how much as come to light about the working conditions and expectations I decided to stick to it as a hobby."

All of the content, i.e. the about me page and projects page, are generated from a JSON file so I don't have to go into the html everytime and copy and paste the same format every single time I wanna add something to it. There aren't any redirects to different pages either, it's all one page with elements being hidden/shown whenever needed. I was told about jellky or something which does basically the same thing after I was done making this but I probably wouldn't have used it either way because I'm not a fan about using other peoples work ~<~"
